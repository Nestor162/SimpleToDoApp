This is a simple Android application that allows you to add new tasks, categorize them, and filter them by category. The app has three categories: Personal, Business, and Other. You can mark tasks as complete or incomplete.

## About the Project

This project was created as an exercise to learn how to use RecyclerView and Lambda functions in Android Studio. It is a simple application that is still a work in progress. There are many features that are not yet implemented, but it is a good starting point for learning how to develop applications in Android Studio.
